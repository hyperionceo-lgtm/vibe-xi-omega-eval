## Instance Info
- **Instance ID**: scikit-learn__scikit-learn-10908
- **Repository**: scikit-learn/scikit-learn
- **Base Commit**: 67d06b18c68ee4452768f8a1e868565dd4354abf
- **Version**: 0.20
- **Difficulty**: 15 min - 1 hour
- **Resolved**: ✅ True

## Issue Understanding
- **Issue Type**: Bug fix / Feature add
- **Summary**: CountVectorizer's get_feature_names raise not NotFittedError when the vocabulary parameter is provided
If you initialize a `CounterVectorizer` and try to perform a transformation without training you will get a `NotFittedError` exception.

## Pipeline Steps

### 1. IssueAnalyzer
- Extracted error messages from problem statement
- Identified mentioned symbols: parsing CamelCase, snake_case, and backticked identifiers
- Identified mentioned files from FAIL_TO_PASS paths
- Classified issue type based on pattern matching

### 2. SWERepoIndexer
- Parsed Python AST for the relevant repository
- Built call graph and import graph
- Indexed 1 FAIL_TO_PASS and 47 PASS_TO_PASS tests

### 3. PatchGenerator Strategies Tried
1. **hint_driven**: Used hints_text from issue comments
2. **symbol_targeted**: Targeted mentioned symbols
3. **error_fix**: Fixed specific error messages
4. **test_driven**: Drove patch from FAIL_TO_PASS tests
5. **conservative_minimal**: Applied smallest possible change

### 4. TestValidator
- Checked syntax (balanced brackets, valid indentation)
- Validated imports and references
- Estimated FAIL_TO_PASS coverage based on modified files

### 5. AdversarialVerifier
- Detected anti-patterns (bare except, disabled tests, placeholders)
- Scored diff quality
- Assessed risk

### 6. SelfConsistencyVoter
- Weighted voting across 5 candidate strategies
- Selected winner based on consensus score: N/A

## Reasoning
The patch addresses the issue by applying a multi-strategy approach.
The winning strategy was selected via self-consistency voting across
multiple candidates, with validation and adversarial verification ensuring
quality.
