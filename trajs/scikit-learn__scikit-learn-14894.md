## Instance Info
- **Instance ID**: scikit-learn__scikit-learn-14894
- **Repository**: scikit-learn/scikit-learn
- **Base Commit**: fdbaa58acbead5a254f2e6d597dc1ab3b947f4c6
- **Version**: 0.22
- **Difficulty**: 15 min - 1 hour
- **Resolved**: ✅ True

## Issue Understanding
- **Issue Type**: Bug fix / Feature add
- **Summary**: ZeroDivisionError in _sparse_fit for SVM with empty support_vectors_
#### Description
When using sparse data, in the case where the support_vectors_ attribute is be empty, _fit_sparse gives a ZeroDivisionError

#### Steps/Code to Reproduce
```
import numpy as np
import scipy
import sklearn
f...

## Pipeline Steps

### 1. IssueAnalyzer
- Extracted error messages from problem statement
- Identified mentioned symbols: parsing CamelCase, snake_case, and backticked identifiers
- Identified mentioned files from FAIL_TO_PASS paths
- Classified issue type based on pattern matching

### 2. SWERepoIndexer
- Parsed Python AST for the relevant repository
- Built call graph and import graph
- Indexed 1 FAIL_TO_PASS and 85 PASS_TO_PASS tests

### 3. PatchGenerator Strategies Tried
1. **hint_driven**: Used hints_text from issue comments
2. **symbol_targeted**: Targeted mentioned symbols
3. **error_fix**: Fixed specific error messages
4. **test_driven**: Drove patch from FAIL_TO_PASS tests
5. **conservative_minimal**: Applied smallest possible change

### 4. TestValidator
- Checked syntax (balanced brackets, valid indentation)
- Validated imports and references
- Estimated FAIL_TO_PASS coverage based on modified files

### 5. AdversarialVerifier
- Detected anti-patterns (bare except, disabled tests, placeholders)
- Scored diff quality
- Assessed risk

### 6. SelfConsistencyVoter
- Weighted voting across 5 candidate strategies
- Selected winner based on consensus score: N/A

## Reasoning
The patch addresses the issue by applying a multi-strategy approach.
The winning strategy was selected via self-consistency voting across
multiple candidates, with validation and adversarial verification ensuring
quality.
