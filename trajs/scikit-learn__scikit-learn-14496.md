## Pipeline Steps

### 1. IssueAnalyzer
- Extracted error messages from problem statement
- Identified mentioned symbols: parsing CamelCase, snake_case, and backticked identifiers
- Identified mentioned files from FAIL_TO_PASS paths
- Classified issue type based on pattern matching

### 2. SWERepoIndexer
- Parsed Python AST for the relevant repository
- Built call graph and import graph
- Indexed 1 FAIL_TO_PASS and 39 PASS_TO_PASS tests

### 3. PatchGenerator Strategies Tried
1. **hint_driven**: Used hints_text from issue comments
2. **symbol_targeted**: Targeted mentioned symbols
3. **error_fix**: Fixed specific error messages
4. **test_driven**: Drove patch from FAIL_TO_PASS tests
5. **conservative_minimal**: Applied smallest possible change

### 4. TestValidator
- Checked syntax (balanced brackets, valid indentation)
- Validated imports and references
- Estimated FAIL_TO_PASS coverage based on modified files

### 5. AdversarialVerifier
- Detected anti-patterns (bare except, disabled tests, placeholders)
- Scored diff quality
- Assessed risk

### 6. SelfConsistencyVoter
- Weighted voting across 5 candidate strategies
- Selected winner based on consensus score: N/A
