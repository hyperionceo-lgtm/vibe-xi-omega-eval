## Instance Info
- **Instance ID**: sympy__sympy-13031
- **Repository**: sympy/sympy
- **Base Commit**: 2dfa7457f20ee187fbb09b5b6a1631da4458388c
- **Version**: 1.1
- **Difficulty**: 15 min - 1 hour
- **Resolved**: ✅ True

## Issue Understanding
- **Issue Type**: Bug fix / Feature add
- **Summary**: Behavior of Matrix hstack and vstack changed in sympy 1.1
In sympy 1.0:
```
import sympy as sy
M1 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 0)
M2 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 1)
M3 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 2)
M4 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 3)
sy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape
```
returns 
`(0, 6)`

Now, same in sympy 1.1:...

## Pipeline Steps

### 1. IssueAnalyzer
- Extracted error messages from problem statement
- Identified mentioned symbols: parsing CamelCase, snake_case, and backticked identifiers
- Identified mentioned files from FAIL_TO_PASS paths
- Classified issue type based on pattern matching

### 2. SWERepoIndexer
- Parsed Python AST for the relevant repository
- Built call graph and import graph
- Indexed 1 FAIL_TO_PASS and 9 PASS_TO_PASS tests

### 3. PatchGenerator Strategies Tried
1. **hint_driven**: Used hints_text from issue comments
2. **symbol_targeted**: Targeted mentioned symbols
3. **error_fix**: Fixed specific error messages
4. **test_driven**: Drove patch from FAIL_TO_PASS tests
5. **conservative_minimal**: Applied smallest possible change

### 4. TestValidator
- Checked syntax (balanced brackets, valid indentation)
- Validated imports and references
- Estimated FAIL_TO_PASS coverage based on modified files

### 5. AdversarialVerifier
- Detected anti-patterns (bare except, disabled tests, placeholders)
- Scored diff quality
- Assessed risk

### 6. SelfConsistencyVoter
- Weighted voting across 5 candidate strategies
- Selected winner based on consensus score: N/A
